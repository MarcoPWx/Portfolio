# How Quiz Optimization Actually Works - Simple Flow

## The Big Picture
```
User Starts Quiz → Check Their Level → Check Recent Performance → Select Smart Questions → Order Them Well → Track Results
```

## Step-by-Step Logic Flow

### 1️⃣ When User Starts a Quiz

```
User selects:
- Category (e.g., "Science")
- Session Type:
  • Quick (5 questions, unlimited lives)
  • Normal (7 questions, 3 lives)
  • Challenge (10 questions, 1 life)
```

### 2️⃣ System Checks User's Skill Level

```sql
-- Simple database query
SELECT total_questions, correct_answers 
FROM user_progress 
WHERE user_id = ? AND category_id = ?

-- Then calculate:
Accuracy = correct_answers / total_questions

If accuracy >= 90% → Level 5 (Expert)
If accuracy >= 80% → Level 4 (Advanced)  
If accuracy >= 70% → Level 3 (Intermediate)
If accuracy >= 60% → Level 2 (Improving)
Else → Level 1 (Beginner)
```

### 3️⃣ Check Recent Performance (Last 10 Questions)

```
Look at last 10 answers:
✓ ✓ ✓ → User is on fire! (3+ correct in row)
✗ ✗ → User is struggling (2+ wrong in row)
✓ ✗ ✓ → User is normal
```

### 4️⃣ Smart Question Selection

The system picks questions based on user's situation:

#### If User is Struggling (2+ wrong):
```
40% EASIER questions (level - 1)
20% REVIEW questions (ones they got wrong before)
40% NORMAL questions (their level)
= Confidence building mix
```

#### If User is Doing Great (3+ correct):
```
30% HARDER questions (level + 1)
20% REVIEW questions (reinforce learning)
50% NORMAL questions (maintain flow)
= Challenge without frustration
```

#### If User is Normal:
```
20% REVIEW questions (spaced repetition)
80% NORMAL questions (their level)
= Steady progress
```

### 5️⃣ Question Ordering (The Secret Sauce)

Questions are ordered for psychological flow:

#### For 5 Question Quiz:
```
1. Easy (warm up)
2. Medium (build confidence)
3. Medium (maintain flow)
4. Hard (peak challenge)
5. Medium (cool down)
```

#### For 7 Question Quiz:
```
1. Easy
2. Easy (build confidence)
3. Medium
4. Medium (establish rhythm)
5. Hard
6. Hard (peak challenge)
7. Medium (satisfying end)
```

#### For 10 Question Quiz:
```
Gradual increase → Peak at 70% → Gradual decrease
```

### 6️⃣ Real-Time Adjustments

After EACH answer, system tracks:
- Was it correct?
- How long did it take?
- What difficulty was it?

This affects the NEXT quiz session.

## Real Example

### Sarah's Quiz Experience:

**Starting State:**
- Level: 2 (Improving)
- Recent: Got 2 wrong in a row
- Selected: Normal mode (7 questions)

**System Decides:**
```
She's struggling, so:
- 3 easier questions (40% of 7)
- 1 review question (20% of 7)  
- 3 normal questions (40% of 7)
```

**Question Order:**
```
1. Easy (warm up, build confidence)
2. Easy (continue building)
3. Review (familiar but needs practice)
4. Normal (test current level)
5. Normal (maintain flow)
6. Easy (prevent frustration)
7. Normal (end on success)
```

**Result:** Sarah gets 5/7 correct, feels good, and continues playing!

## Why This Works

### 🧠 Psychology:
- **Never too easy:** Adjusts up when you're doing well
- **Never too hard:** Adjusts down when struggling
- **Always engaging:** Mix of review + new content

### 📊 Data-Driven:
- Tracks everything
- Learns your patterns
- Improves over time

### 🎮 Gamification:
- XP scales with difficulty
- Unlocks based on performance
- Encouragement when needed

## The Database Tables (Simple!)

### user_progress
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_progress (
  user_id UUID,
  category_id UUID,
  total_questions INT,
  correct_answers INT,
  current_level INT,
  unlocked_hints BOOLEAN,
  unlocked_challenge BOOLEAN,
  unlocked_multiplayer BOOLEAN
);
```

### question_history
```sql
CREATE TABLE question_history (
  user_id UUID,
  question_id UUID,
  category_id UUID,
  is_correct BOOLEAN,
  difficulty INT,
  time_spent INT,
  answered_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### questions
```sql
CREATE TABLE questions (
  id UUID,
  category_id UUID,
  question TEXT,
  options JSON,
  correct_answer INT,
  difficulty INT (1-5),
  last_shown TIMESTAMP
);
```
