## 🛑 STOP/START Actions

### STOP Immediately
1. Creating new features
2. Writing disconnected services
3. Adding more TypeScript files
4. Writing tests for mock data
5. Claiming things are "done"

### START Immediately
1. Defining requirements
2. Connecting ONE service end-to-end
3. Implementing error handling
4. Adding real tests
5. Being honest about readiness

## 📊 Success Metrics for Production

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] < 0.1% error rate
- [ ] > 99.9% uptime
- [ ] < 500ms P95 latency
- [ ] > 80% test coverage
- [ ] Zero data loss incidents

### Business Metrics
- [ ] User registration working
- [ ] Quiz completion rate > 80%
- [ ] Data persistence verified
- [ ] Analytics tracking confirmed

## 🔴 Final Verdict

**PRODUCTION READY: ❌ ABSOLUTELY NOT**

**Estimated Time to Production: 4-6 weeks with 3-4 developers**

**Next Action: STOP building features, START connecting what exists**
