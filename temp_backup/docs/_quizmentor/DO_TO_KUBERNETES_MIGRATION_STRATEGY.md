# DigitalOcean to Kubernetes Migration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the decision framework and migration path from DigitalOcean App Platform to Kubernetes for QuizMentor as the application scales beyond 1000 users.

**Current Status**: The application is designed to start on DigitalOcean App Platform (simpler, managed) and migrate to Kubernetes when complexity and scale justify it.

## When to Migrate: Decision Matrix

### Stay on DigitalOcean App Platform When:

| Criteria | Threshold | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| **User Count** | < 5,000 concurrent | App Platform auto-scaling handles this well |
| **Monthly Cost** | < $2,000 | Managed services cost-effective at this scale |
| **Team Size** | < 5 developers | Limited DevOps expertise needed |
| **Services** | < 10 microservices | Simple architecture manageable |
| **Customization** | Standard deployments | Platform constraints acceptable |
| **Regions** | Single region | No complex geo-distribution needed |
| **Compliance** | Basic requirements | Platform security sufficient |

### Migrate to Kubernetes When:

| Trigger | Indicator | Impact |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Scale** | > 5,000 concurrent users | Need fine-grained resource control |
| **Cost** | > $2,000/month | K8s becomes more cost-effective |
| **Complexity** | > 10 microservices | Need service mesh, advanced networking |
| **Customization** | Custom operators needed | Platform limitations blocking features |
| **Multi-region** | Global presence required | Need geo-distributed clusters |
| **Compliance** | HIPAA/PCI/SOC2 | Need detailed security controls |
| **Performance** | < 100ms P99 latency | Need proximity to users |

  - Centralized logging
  - Auto-scaling everything

Cost: $500-2000/month
```

## Technical Migration Guide

### Step 1: Containerization Check
```dockerfile
# Ensure all services have optimized Dockerfiles
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Step 2: Create Kubernetes Manifests
```yaml
# Already created in k8s/ directory:
- deployments/
- services/
- configmaps/
- secrets/
- ingress/
- self-healing/
  - hpa.yaml (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
  - pdb.yaml (PodDisruptionBudget)
```

### Step 3: Database Migration Strategy
```yaml
Option 1 - Keep Managed:
  - Continue using Supabase
  - Or use DO Managed Database
  - Pros: No maintenance, backups handled
  - Cons: Higher cost, less control

Option 2 - Self-Managed:
  - Run Postgres in Kubernetes
  - Use operators (CloudNativePG)
  - Pros: Full control, lower cost
  - Cons: Maintenance overhead

Recommendation:
  < 10,000 users: Managed
  > 10,000 users: Self-managed with operator
```

### Step 4: Data Migration
```bash
# Zero-downtime migration process

# 1. Set up replication
pg_dump --schema-only source_db | psql target_db

# 2. Initial data copy
pg_dump --data-only source_db | psql target_db

# 3. Set up CDC (Change Data Capture)
# Use Debezium or similar

# 4. Switchover
# - Stop writes to old DB
# - Final sync
# - Update connection strings
# - Resume writes to new DB
```

### Step 5: Traffic Migration
```yaml
# Gradual traffic shift using weighted routing

# 10% traffic to Kubernetes
- host: api.quizmentor.com
  http:
    paths:
    - path: /
      backend:
        service:
          name: api-service
          port: 80
      weight: 10  # 10% to K8s
    - path: /
      backend:
        service:
          name: legacy-app-platform
          port: 80
      weight: 90  # 90% to App Platform

# Gradually increase K8s percentage
# Monitor metrics at each stage
# Full cutover when stable
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Data Loss** | Automated backups, point-in-time recovery |
| **Downtime** | Blue-green deployment, gradual rollout |
| **Performance Degradation** | Load testing, monitoring, rollback plan |
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | Security scanning, RBAC, network policies |
| **Cost Overrun** | Resource limits, monitoring, alerts |

### Rollback Strategy

```yaml
Rollback Triggers:
  - Error rate > 5%
  - P99 latency > 2000ms  
  - Database connection errors
  - Memory/CPU exhaustion

Rollback Process:
  1. Switch DNS back to App Platform (< 1 min)
  2. Or use Ingress to route to App Platform
  3. Investigate and fix issues
  4. Retry migration with fixes
```

## Monitoring During Migration

### Key Metrics to Track

```yaml
Business Metrics:
  - User experience scores
  - Transaction success rate
  - Page load times
  - Error rates by endpoint

Technical Metrics:
  - Request latency (P50, P95, P99)
  - Error rates (4xx, 5xx)
  - Database query times
  - Cache hit rates
  - Resource utilization

Migration Specific:
  - Traffic distribution %
  - Response time comparison
  - Error rate comparison
  - Cost per request
```

### Success Criteria

```yaml
