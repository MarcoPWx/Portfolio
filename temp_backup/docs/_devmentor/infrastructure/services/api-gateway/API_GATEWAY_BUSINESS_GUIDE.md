# API Gateway Business Guide (Project Context)

Purpose: Explain how the API Gateway is used in this project (DevMentor/NatureQuest context), how responsibilities are split, and how it ties into Swagger/OpenAPI, PBML for infinite context, QWEN, Qdrant, and PostgreSQL.

- Not pricing-focused
- Not a sales doc
- Strictly technical usage context and governance

Sections to populate next:
- Responsibilities and non-responsibilities of the gateway
- Integration contracts (OpenAPI) and validation at the edge
- Policy model: auth, rate limits, cache, transform
- Edge-to-core routes for QWEN/PBML/Qdrant/Postgres
- Testing matrix (10 types) mapped to gateway and services
