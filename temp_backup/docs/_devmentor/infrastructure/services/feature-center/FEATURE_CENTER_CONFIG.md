CURRENT ARCHITECTURE

### 1. Basic Service Setup
```yaml
# This is the main Feature Center service configuration
name: feature-center        # The service name
port: 8084                 # Where it listens for requests
version: 1.0.0             # Current version
type: core-service         # It's a main DevMentor service
```

### 2. What It Needs to Run
```yaml
# Resources needed by Feature Center
memory:
  minimum: 512MB     # Won't start with less
  preferred: 1GB     # Works best with this
cpu:
  minimum: "0.25"    # Quarter of a CPU core
  preferred: "0.5"   # Half a CPU core
storage:
  type: postgresql   # Uses PostgreSQL database
  size: 10GB        # Needs this much space
```

### 3. How It Connects to Other Services
```yaml
# Connection details (simplified)
connections:
  devlog:
    url: http://devlog-service:8085
    type: http
    purpose: "Stores development history"

  tdd-service:
    url: http://tdd-service:8087
    type: http
    purpose: "Manages test workflows"

  ai-service:
    url: http://ai-service:8088
    type: http
    purpose: "Provides AI assistance"
```

## Main Features üåü

### 1. Task Handling
```python
# Example of how tasks are managed
task_config = {
    "types": ["feature", "bug", "improvement"],
    "states": ["new", "in-progress", "review", "done"],
    "priorities": ["low", "medium", "high", "urgent"]
}
```

### 2. Development Workflows
```yaml
# Supported development workflows
workflows:
  tdd:                     # Test Driven Development
    phases: 
      - red               # Write failing test
      - green            # Make test pass
      - refactor         # Improve code
    
  standard:               # Regular Development
    phases:
      - code
      - test
      - review
```

### 3. Service Communication
```yaml
# How Feature Center talks to others

## Need Help? ü§ù

### Common Issues
1. Can't connect to other services?
   ```bash
   # Check service health
   curl http://feature-center:8084/health
   ```

2. Task not starting?
   ```bash
   # Check task status
   curl http://feature-center:8084/api/v1/tasks/{task_id}
   ```

3. Workflow stuck?
   ```bash
   # Check workflow status
   curl http://feature-center:8084/api/v1/workflows/{task_id}
   ```

### Getting Support
- Check logs: `docker logs feature-center`
- Health API: `/health`
- Documentation: `/docs`

Remember: Feature Center is designed to be developer-friendly. If something's not working, it's probably trying to tell you what's wrong through its health checks and logs!
