Quick Navigation
- Overview
- Quick Status Grid
- Critical Path and Gating Criteria
- Service-by-Service Highlights
- Risks and Mitigations
- Today: Quick Actions
- This Week: Must-Do Items

Overview
- Frontend reorg complete; 86 components by feature with strong tests (SYSTEM_STATUS)
- Kubernetes cluster running with observability stack; some duplication to consolidate (EPIC_MANAGEMENT)
- Auth service: core endpoints scaffolded; security hardening, email flows, and CSRF pending (AUTH_BETA_READINESS)
- AI Gateway: working with Ollama; multi-provider, security, and cost/governance features required for beta (AI_GATEWAY_BETA_READINESS)
- Project service feature-complete; integration and deployment pending (PROJECT_SERVICE_COMPLETE_BETA_READINESS)
- Memory service scaffolding present; Qdrant integration and minimal RAG path needed (MEMORY_SERVICE_BETA_READINESS)

Cluster/Infra                ðŸŸ¡       Running; consolidate obs stack, finalize Istio
API Gateway                  ðŸŸ¡       JWT, rate limit ok; ensure /health green & routes
AI Gateway                   ðŸ”´       45% ready; add OpenAI/Anthropic, PII, cost tracking
Auth Service                 ðŸŸ¡       Core in place; implement lockout, CSRF, email flows
Project Service              ðŸŸ¡       Ready features; deploy + connect frontend
Memory Service               ðŸ”´       Qdrant integration, embeddings, minimal RAG
Observability                ðŸŸ¡       Stack deployed; deduplicate, dashboards, alerts
Frontend Integration         ðŸŸ¡       Connect to real backends via gateway
E2E Flows                    ðŸŸ¡       Many tests exist; auth + tasks flows need wiring
Docs/Runbooks                ðŸŸ¡       Good coverage; add quickstart + env templates

Critical Path and Gating Criteria
Must pass to declare Beta Ready:
1) Platform Green
   - Kind cluster healthy; namespaces present
   - Istio mTLS enforced for services; ingress stable
   - Single observability stack (Prom, Grafana, Loki) with dashboards
2) Authentication Functional and Secure
   - Email/pass login, GitHub OAuth, JWT (access 15m, refresh 7d)
   - Account lockout, CSRF protection, password policy
   - Email verification and password reset flows
3) Frontend Connected to Backends
   - Authenticated routes; session persistence
   - Tasks/epics list from project-service via API gateway
4) AI Gateway Minimum Beta Feature Set
   - 3+ providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) behind unified API
   - PII detection/redaction; basic prompt-injection checks
   - Basic cost tracking and provider failover
   - Health metrics and dashboards
5) Memory Minimal Viable RAG
   - Qdrant connected; store/retrieve path; embeddings endpoint
   - Health and metrics endpoints
6) E2E Smoke Suite
   - Login/signup/verify â†’ dashboard
   - Create/update task â†’ realtime update visible
   - AI chat basic request â†’ response path via gateway

Service-by-Service Highlights
API Gateway (docs/infrastructure/services/api-gateway/...)
- Ready: JWT validation, rate limiting, proxy routing, security headers
- Actions: Confirm routes to auth, project, memory, ai; add health probes and dashboards

AI Gateway (docs/infrastructure/services/ai-gateway/...)
- Status: 45% ready; Ollama only in production doc; roadmap defined
- Actions (week 1-2): add OpenAI + Anthropic providers, provider abstraction, PII detector, basic cost tracking; streaming stable; unify errors

Auth Service (docs/infrastructure/services/auth-service/...)
- Actions: implement lockout, CSRF, strong password validator, email verification + password reset; secure JWT config; audit events

Project Service (docs/infrastructure/services/project-service/...)
- Actions: deploy to K8s, seed data, verify endpoints; connect frontend via gateway; add WS realtime updates

Memory Service (docs/infrastructure/services/memory-service/...)
- Actions: configure Qdrant client, embeddings, store/retrieve, agent partitions; add simple health/metrics

Redis/Postgres (docs/infrastructure/services/redis|database/...)
- Actions: verify persistence, credentials via secrets, readiness/liveness, metrics; ensure rate-limit keys and session storage

Swagger (docs/infrastructure/services/swagger/...)
- Actions: aggregate OpenAPI specs (auth, ai, project, memory) and expose

Testing (docs/status/testing/...)
- Actions: extend smoke E2E for auth, tasks, AI gateway paths; add minimal integration tests per service route

Risks and Mitigations
- Security gaps (CSRF, lockout, PII): implement per AUTH/AI_GATEWAY guides
- Cost overrun via AI: enable budget/cost tracking and provider caps
- Provider instability: implement failover and caching basics
- Observability duplication: consolidate to one stack to reduce confusion and noise

Today: Quick Actions
- Verify cluster core
  kubectl cluster-info
  kubectl get pods -A | grep -E "istio|ingress|postgres|redis|ai-gateway|api-gateway|ollama"
- API/AI health
  curl -sS http://localhost:8080/health || true
  curl -sS http://localhost:3001/health || true
- Observability check
  kubectl get svc,deploy -A | grep -E "grafana|prometheus|loki|alert"

This Week: Must-Do Items
- Auth (Days 1-2): lockout, CSRF, email verify/reset, JWT config; tests
- AI Gateway (Days 2-5): OpenAI + Anthropic providers, PII, basic cost; provider failover; dashboards
- Project + Frontend (Days 3-4): deploy project-service, wire UI via gateway, WS updates
- Memory (Day 5): Qdrant store/retrieve; embeddings path; minimal RAG
- Observability (Ongoing): consolidate stack, core dashboards, a basic alert
- Docs: .env templates, Quickstart updates, API docs consolidated

Owners (Initial)
- Platform/DevOps: Cluster/Istio/Observability
- Backend: Auth, Project, Memory, AI Gateway providers
- Frontend: Auth routes, API client, tasks UI wiring, realtime
- QA: E2E smoke + integration

Definition of Beta Success (derived)
- Platform green + single observability stack
- Auth functional and secure; flows verified
- Frontend integrated with core services
- AI Gateway with 3 providers + security + basic cost
- Memory minimal RAG working
- Smoke E2E suite passing and dashboards operational

Update â€” 2025-08-24 Decisions & Must-Do Additions
- Decisions:
  - Feature flags: OpenFeature + Unleash (self-hosted).
  - Secrets: Vault + External Secrets Operator (ESO); no secrets in code.
  - Traffic: Istio Gateway/VirtualService/DestinationRule canary subsets; ServiceEntry for approved egress; mTLS PERMISSIVE in dev.
- Must-Do (add to This Week):
  - Deploy Unleash in devmentor-app; create flags new-ui-enabled, ai-safety-pii, ai-provider-openai-enabled.
  - Integrate OpenFeature SDK in api-gateway and ai-gateway; add basic flag checks.
  - Install/configure ESO with Vault; ExternalSecrets for api-gateway/auth/ai/postgres/redis.
  - Prepare Istio manifest for devmentor.local (v1/v2 subsets) to enable canary.
- Runbooks:
  - docs/infrastructure/runbooks/RUNBOOK_runtime-control.md
  - docs/infrastructure/runbooks/RUNBOOK_feature-flags_unleash.md
  - docs/infrastructure/runbooks/RUNBOOK_external-secrets_vault.md
