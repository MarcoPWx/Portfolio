- Added consolidated SCDD whitepaper (v0.2) under docs/infrastructure/whitepapers.
- Acceptance criteria: all PRs cite relevant /docs sections + contract SHAs; append-only logs updated per change.
- Next: add PR template enforcing citations; define small-PR size thresholds by file/LOC; publish runbook skeleton.

### 2025-08-25 11:51 UTC ‚Äî SCDD 7‚Äì11 refinement (append-only)
- Guardrails now mapped to runbooks with explicit procedures (Quick Canary, idempotent seeding, ESO reconciliation).
- Governance additions: RBC matrix + policy-as-code checks (doc-citations, contract diff, PR size limits, secret scanning).
- Adoption playbook updated: week-by-week with runbook-first drills.
- Definition of Done extension for risky changes: contract + tests + runbook reference + DEVLOG/SYSTEM_STATUS append + evidence (Playwright artifacts/trace links).

### 2025-08-25 11:55 UTC ‚Äî Whitepaper tuned to /docs paths (append-only)
- Section 7 now lists the exact /docs locations for contracts, ADRs, runbooks, and logs, and defines the change bundle.
- Section 8 points to /docs/status/testing/* for Playwright practices and to /docs/status/slis_slos for budgets.
- Section 9 enumerates the three core runbooks and when to apply them.
- Section 10 links governance to runtime-control and CI checks.
- Section 11 updates adoption to runbook-first drills and PR doc-citation enforcement.

### 2025-08-25 11:59 UTC ‚Äî SCDD methodology philosophy update (append-only)
- Whitepaper sections 7-11 revised to explain HOW the methodology works vs implementation details
- Focus shifted to philosophy: every change knows where it came from; evidence as first-class citizen
- Guardrails described as patterns encoded in runbooks, not rules to memorize
- Observability framed as layered storytelling for 3 AM debugging
- DevMentor shown as example of runbook-first mindset and compound learning
- Governance presented as encoding wisdom from incidents rather than imposing rules
- Adoption path emphasizes creating memory system first, then incrementally adding value
- Success signs: smaller PRs, reusable runbooks, AI suggestions get more specific
- Source of truth: docs/status/K8S_DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md
- Overall: PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL (Kind cluster: devmentor)
- Running in K8s: Postgres, Redis, Ollama, AI Gateway, Istio (istiod, ingress), Kiali, Prometheus, Grafana
- Running in Docker (standalone): Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail, Node Exporter, Monitoring Service
- Issues: Duplicate observability stacks; Auth-service build/deploy fixes; Keycloak restarts; one Ollama replica previously Pending (now scaled to 1)
- Immediate next steps: Rebuild/redeploy auth-service; migrate monitoring-service to K8s; consolidate to single observability stack; finalize Keycloak and Istio policies

## Devlog Reference

### 2025-08-23 13:13 UTC
- Section: Cluster up and routing verification
- Tags: k8s,istio,ingress,virtualservice,ai-gateway

Updates
- Verified kind-devmentor context and cluster health
- Port-forwarded istio-ingressgateway to 8080 for local access
- Added VirtualService rewrite so /api/ai/pbml/* reaches ai-gateway‚Äôs /api/pbml/*
- Next: decide whether to deploy API Gateway to consolidate routing on :8080; confirm observability UIs via port-forward

### 2025-08-21 23:43:57 CEST
- Section: Observability rollout
- Tags: epic,status,observability,k8s

EPIC: Observability consolidation
Status: In-progress; core stack running via kube-prometheus-stack. Overlay applied manually (kustomize blocked by external file paths).

Today
- Fixed PrometheusRule YAML error
- Applied Istio PodMonitor and ServiceMonitor
- Created ConfigMaps for Grafana dashboards and datasources with required sidecar labels
- Verified resources present
- Started port-forwards for Grafana/Prometheus/Alertmanager

Risks/Blockers
- Kustomize overlay references files outside overlay dir; need restructuring or alternative (scripts) to avoid security restriction.

Next
- Restructure overlay to make kustomize self-contained OR keep script-based apply
- Validate dashboards appear and Prometheus has Istio/Envoy targets up
- Configure Alertmanager routing (receivers) if needed

## 2025-08-23 ‚Äî Auth Decision Locked + Revised Week 1 Plan (Keycloak)

Decision
- Keycloak is the committed auth path for beta. No temporary auth gate. All services will validate JWTs issued by Keycloak (OIDC). Istio mTLS will be enforced where applicable after basic routing is green.

Why now
- Unblocks P0 epics (EPIC-AUTH-NEW and Service Standardization) and enables a single trusted identity across UI, API Gateway, and core services.

### Day-by-Day (72h) Critical Path

Day 1 ‚Äî Keycloak running in cluster
- [ ] Deploy Keycloak + PostgreSQL in namespace devmentor-app (or devmentor)
- [ ] Expose Keycloak via ClusterIP + Ingress (http(s)://keycloak.local or gateway path /auth)
- [ ] Verify readiness probes pass and pod is stable ‚â• 10m
- [ ] Create admin user and confirm web console access
- [ ] Record service DNS for OIDC (e.g., http://keycloak.devmentor-app.svc:8080)

Day 2 ‚Äî Realm, clients, JWT validation at gateway, basic login
- [ ] Create realm: DevMentor
- [ ] Clients:
  - [ ] devmentor-frontend (public SPA; PKCE; redirect URIs http://localhost:3000/* and beta domain)
  - [ ] api-gateway (confidential; client credentials for service-to-service as needed)
  - [ ] ai-gateway, project-service (confidential) if they call Keycloak directly
- [ ] Roles: admin, user; (optional) service roles
- [ ] API Gateway: enable JWT validation with:
  - [ ] Issuer: https://<gateway-domain>/auth/realms/DevMentor (or internal Keycloak URL)
  - [ ] JWKS URL: https://<gateway-domain>/auth/realms/DevMentor/protocol/openid-connect/certs
  - [ ] Audience/client checks for api-gateway
- [ ] Frontend: OIDC code flow (PKCE) wiring; protected routes; logout; token storage (httpOnly cookie or memory)
- [ ] E2E: Login spec runs against real Keycloak (non-production realm)

Day 3 ‚Äî Project data + minimal end-to-end path
- [ ] Deploy project-service (K8s) and seed minimal data
- [ ] Route through API Gateway with JWT required (401 when missing/invalid)
- [ ] Frontend lists Projects ‚Üí Epics ‚Üí Tasks via gateway
- [ ] Memory-service minimal round-trip (store/retrieve) can be run after auth path is stable
- [ ] Observability: one Grafana dashboard with service health; logs centralized in Loki

### Implementation Checklists

Keycloak Deployment
- [ ] Stateful DB (PostgreSQL) bound; storage class verified
- [ ] Liveness/readiness probes tuned (Keycloak can need longer initial delay)
- [ ] Admin credentials stored as Kubernetes Secret
- [ ] Ingress TLS (self-signed acceptable for beta) or local-only via port-forward

Realm & Clients
- [ ] Realm DevMentor created
- [ ] Clients configured with correct redirect/logout URIs
- [ ] Test user(s): alice@example.com, bob@example.com with role user (and admin for one)
- [ ] Optional: Email settings deferred for beta (manual verification acceptable)

API Gateway JWT Validation
- [ ] Configure issuer and JWKS
- [ ] Map scopes/roles ‚Üí route protection (e.g., /api/projects requires user)
- [ ] Add rate limit and CORS as documented
- [ ] Health: /health returns 200; unauthorized requests return 401 as expected

Frontend Integration
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_OIDC_ISSUER, NEXT_PUBLIC_OIDC_CLIENT_ID set
- [ ] Login ‚Üí redirect to Keycloak ‚Üí redirect back with code ‚Üí session established
- [ ] Protected routes render only when authenticated; logout clears session
- [ ] Playwright: login flow green; artifacts (videos/screenshots/traces) retained on failure

Service Integration
- [ ] project-service enforces JWT; extracts user from token (subject/roles)
- [ ] ai-gateway accepts authenticated calls (anonymous allowed only where intended)
- [ ] memory-service behind gateway (optional for beta scope)

Observability Consolidation (parallel, lightweight)
- [ ] Single Prometheus + Grafana + Loki; remove duplicate stacks
- [ ] Provision a basic ‚ÄúCore Services‚Äù dashboard (gateway, auth, project, ai)

### Acceptance Criteria (Beta-Blocking)
- Can log in via Keycloak and reach the dashboard
- GET /api/projects returns 200 with valid JWT; 401 without/invalid
- Frontend shows Projects ‚Üí Epics/Tasks backed by live project-service
- Playwright login spec passes against real Keycloak; artifacts saved
- One Grafana dashboard loads; pods visible and healthy

### Environment Variables (reference)

- Full learning-engine capabilities
- Istio authorization policies beyond minimal mTLS/JWT checks

Ownership & Dates
- Owner: DevOps + Backend
- Target: Day 3 from this update
- Status roll-ups: Update below daily under this section


### 2025-08-23 ‚Äî Observability rollout (Dashboard upgrade)
- Added multi-panel terminal dashboard (scripts/obs dashboard) for live Ops view
- Integrated Prometheus targets, Grafana provisioning summary, Kiali status, recent logs
- Background PF manager for Grafana/Prometheus/Alertmanager
Next: keyboard shortcuts; restructure observability overlay for kustomize-only apply

## 2025-08-24 ‚Äî Beta Readiness Decision and Sprint Plan

Decision
- Public beta: No-Go today. Proceed with a 10‚Äì14 day Private Beta Readiness Sprint; re-evaluate Go/No-Go at the end. We will ‚Äútake the time it takes.‚Äù
- Gating criteria remain unchanged (see BETA_READINESS_SNAPSHOT). Beta is declared only when all gates are green.

### EPIC-RUNTIME-CONTROL: Secrets, Remote Config, Feature Flags, and Traffic Management
**Status**: üü° PLANNED (Beta Readiness Sprint) | **Owner**: Platform + Backend | **Due**: Within Private Beta Readiness Sprint

Summary
- Centralize secrets via Vault + External Secrets Operator (ESO), enable runtime feature flags with OpenFeature (self-hosted provider), support minimal remote config for non-secret knobs, and standardize ingress/egress + canary routing via Istio.

Objectives
- Secrets: No secrets in code/commits. All sensitive values sourced from Vault and synced by ESO to K8s Secrets.
- Flags: Feature toggles and experiments without redeploys; per-user/segment targeting where needed.
- Remote config: Typed non-secret settings adjustable at runtime; initially via flags, optionally a small config-service later.
- Traffic: Istio Gateway/VirtualService/DestinationRule for routing and canary; ServiceEntry for controlled egress; PeerAuthentication for mTLS (STRICT in non-dev).

Deliverables
- ESO installed and configured with ClusterSecretStore for Vault
- ExternalSecrets for: api-gateway, ai-gateway, auth-service, postgres, redis
- Self-hosted feature flag provider deployed (Unleash or Flagsmith)
- OpenFeature SDK integrated into api-gateway and ai-gateway behind at least 3 flags
- Istio manifest applied: Gateway, VirtualService, DestinationRules (subsets v1/v2), ServiceEntry, PeerAuthentication (dev: PERMISSIVE, later STRICT)
- Runbook: RUNBOOK_runtime-control.md with verification and rollback
- Dashboards: basic Grafana panels for Gateway/Auth/AI + flag metrics

Scope & Tasks
1) Secrets Foundation (Vault + ESO)
- [ ] Install ESO; set up ClusterSecretStore for Vault (K8s auth)
- [ ] Create ExternalSecrets for service creds (JWT_SECRET, REDIS_URL, DB creds)
- [ ] Update Deployments to envFrom secrets; verify pods receive values
- [ ] Rotate one secret and verify sync + rollout

2) Feature Flags (OpenFeature + Provider)
- [ ] Choose provider (default: Unleash self-hosted)
- [ ] Deploy provider to devmentor-app; create initial flags
- [ ] Integrate OpenFeature SDK in api-gateway and ai-gateway
- [ ] Gate first features: new-ui-enabled, ai-safety-pii, ai-provider-openai-enabled
- [ ] Add a minimal admin page/endpoint to read flag states (non-secret)

3) Remote Config (Minimal)
- [ ] Define typed config keys (timeouts, cache TTLs)
- [ ] Represent as typed flags initially
- [ ] Optional: config-service sketch using Redis pub/sub for live updates

4) Traffic Management (Istio)
- [ ] Apply Gateway/VirtualService for devmentor.local
- [ ] Add DestinationRules with subsets v1/v2 for ai-gateway, auth-service
- [ ] Label Deployments with version: v1 (and v2 when canarying)
- [ ] Add ServiceEntry for approved egress hosts (OpenAI/Anthropic/etc.)
- [ ] Optional: PeerAuthentication PERMISSIVE in dev; STRICT when stable

5) Verification & Observability
- [ ] Kiali shows sidecars and routes to services
- [ ] Grafana dashboards display gateway/auth/ai and flag metrics
- [ ] Smoke: flip new-ui-enabled for a test user; validate behavior without restart
- [ ] Canary: shift 10% traffic to ai-gateway v2; observe and rollback

Acceptance Criteria
- Secrets are delivered solely via ESO-managed K8s Secrets
- Feature flags toggle behavior live (per user) without pod restarts
- Minimal remote config (timeouts/TTLs) adjustable via flags; changes observed
- Istio routes stable; canary shift 90/10 ‚Üí 100/0 within 5 minutes with no errors > 1%
- Runbook steps repeatable by any on-call; verification and rollback documented

Risks & Mitigations
- Provider/flag outage ‚Üí default SDK values; keep critical toggles default-safe
- Misrouted traffic ‚Üí keep ‚Äúkill switch‚Äù VirtualService and fast rollback steps in runbook
- Secret sync lag ‚Üí cache TTL and forced rollout guidance in runbook

Dependencies
- Istio installed and ingress port-forward available
- Vault reachable from cluster (or alternative secret store)
- Monitoring stack accessible (Grafana/Prometheus/Kiali)

Progress ‚Äî 2025-08-25 11:10 UTC
- Manifests scaffolded:
  - Unleash: infrastructure/k8s/unleash/unleash.yaml (Namespace, Secret unleash-admin, Deployment/Service)
  - ESO/Vault: infrastructure/k8s/secrets/externalsecrets.yaml (ClusterSecretStore + ExternalSecrets for core services)
  - Istio: infrastructure/k8s/istio/devmentor-traffic.yaml (Gateway/VirtualService/DestinationRules/ServiceEntry/PeerAuth)
- Service code updated:
  - API Gateway: prefer REDIS_URL; added /flags stub
  - AI Gateway: flags stub added to /health
- Outstanding to DO (this epic):
  - Populate Vault with required keys (REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, REDIS_LEARNING_URL)
  - Install/configure ESO if not present; verify ExternalSecret sync
  - Deploy Unleash and seed initial flags (new-ui-enabled, ai-safety-pii, ai-provider-openai-enabled)
  - Optionally wire OpenFeature provider in code (beyond stubs) once Unleash URL/token decided
  - Label Deployments with version: v1 and create v2 for canary; confirm VirtualService weights in Kiali
- Acceptance checkpoints:
  - Flags toggle behavior live without restarts (observed via /flags and UI changes)
  - Secrets only via ESO-managed K8s Secrets; no secrets in Git
  - Istio routes stable; canary shift 90/10 ‚Üí 100/0 with no >1% error rate
