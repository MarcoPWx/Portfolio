# 📊 DevMentor System Status & Implementation Epics
## Current State, Priorities, and Actionable Work Items

## Executive Summary

**We're ready to BUILD!** All planning is complete. We have:
- ✅ Complete user journeys documented
- ✅ Backend flow architecture defined
- ✅ Deployment strategy (Supabase + DO → K8s later)
- ✅ Monitoring and SRE practices documented
- ✅ Clear path to avoid Istio complexity until needed

## 🎯 Why We Don't Need Istio Now

```yaml
What Istio Would Give Us:
  ❌ Service mesh complexity → Not needed with 5 services
  ❌ mTLS between services → Supabase RLS is sufficient
  ❌ Traffic management → Digital Ocean handles this
  ❌ Distributed tracing → Sentry APM is enough
  
What We're Using Instead:
  ✅ Feature flags (instead of canary deployments)
  ✅ Code-level circuit breakers (simpler than Istio)
  ✅ axios-retry (instead of Istio retries)
  ✅ Sentry APM (instead of Jaeger)
  
When to Add Istio:
  - When we have 10+ microservices
  - When we exceed 1000 RPS
  - When we need multi-region deployments
  - It's EASY to add later (transparent to services)
```

    * You review and test
    * Iterate until perfect
  
Phase 2 (3-4 days):
  - EPIC 2: Learning Session MVP (You + Me)
    * Build incrementally
    * Test each component
    * Real-time debugging
  
Phase 3 (1-2 days):
