## üí° Pro Tips for Learning

1. **Hands-On First**: Always have terminal open while reading
2. **Take Notes**: Document commands that work for you
3. **Break Things**: Intentionally break services to learn recovery
4. **Ask Why**: For each command, understand what it does
5. **Build Mental Models**: Draw diagrams of how services connect

---

## üÜò When You're Stuck

1. Check logs: `kubectl logs <pod> -n devmentor`
2. Describe resource: `kubectl describe <resource> <name> -n devmentor`
3. Check events: `kubectl get events -n devmentor`
4. Review this guide's relevant phase
5. Check the debugging guide

---

## üöÄ After Completion

Once you've completed all phases, you'll be able to:
- Deploy and manage microservices on Kubernetes
