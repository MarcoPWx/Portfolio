# 📝 HARVEST.AI DEVELOPMENT LOG
*Track daily progress, decisions, and learnings*

---

## December 26, 2024

### 🎯 Day 1: Project Genesis

**Time:** 13:30 - 14:30 (1 hour)

#### What We Started With
- Idea: "Turn any knowledge source into any format"
- Inspiration: QuizMentor's question generation capabilities
- Goal: Build a content transformation platform with BYOK model

#### What We Accomplished
1. **Created comprehensive documentation** ✅
   - Value proposition defined
   - 100 use cases documented
   - Competitive analysis complete
   - Market positioning clear

2. **Set up project structure** ✅
   - `/docs` folder organized
   - Frontend initialized with Next.js
   - Tailwind configured with orange theme
   - Navigation component created

3. **Designed core architecture** ✅
   - Blackboard pattern for multi-agent system
   - Concurrency patterns documented
   - AI gateway design complete
   - Database schema planned

4. **Identified key differentiators** ✅
   - RAG-based verification (unique)
   - 20+ output formats (vs 1-5 competitors)
   - Real-time web scraping (ChatGPT can't)
   - BYOK model (nobody else)
   - 30-second generation (vs 6 hours manual)

#### Key Decisions Made
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js + FastAPI + Supabase
- **Color Scheme:** Orange (inspired by Supabase design)
- **MVP Focus:** Start with quiz generation, expand later
- **Timeline:** 4 weeks to MVP, 6-8 weeks to production

#### Blockers Encountered
- ❌ No backend code exists yet
- ❌ No API integrations
- ❌ No database configured
- ❌ Need OpenAI API key for testing

#### Tomorrow's Priority
1. Create FastAPI backend structure
2. Set up Supabase project
3. Implement basic BYOK validation
4. Connect frontend to backend

#### Lessons Learned
- Documentation first approach helps clarify vision
- QuizMentor code can be adapted (question generator)
- Need to START BUILDING, not just planning

## December 27, 2024 (Planned)

### 🎯 Day 2: Backend Foundation

**Goal:** Get FastAPI running with basic endpoints

#### Morning (9:00 - 12:00)
- [ ] Create backend folder structure
- [ ] Set up FastAPI with uvicorn
- [ ] Create basic models/schemas
- [ ] Implement health check endpoint

#### Afternoon (13:00 - 17:00)
- [ ] Set up Supabase project
- [ ] Create database schema
- [ ] Connect FastAPI to Supabase
- [ ] Test database operations

#### Evening (19:00 - 21:00)
- [ ] Create `/api/generate` endpoint
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Write basic tests

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] API responds at localhost:8000
- [ ] Database connected and working
- [ ] Can make POST to /api/generate
- [ ] Errors return proper JSON

## Project Insights & Patterns

### 🔍 Observations

#### What's Working
- Clear vision and value proposition
- Strong documentation foundation
- Good architectural patterns identified
- Frontend setup is clean

#### What's Not Working
- No actual functionality yet
- Too much planning, not enough building
- Missing critical integrations
- No testing framework

### 📊 Velocity Tracking

|------|----------------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Dec 26 | 0 | 0 (setup day) | 4 | N/A |
| Dec 27 | 4 | TBD | TBD | TBD |

### 🧠 Technical Decisions Log

| Decision | Date | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|----------|------|-----------|------------------------|
| Use FastAPI | Dec 26 | Fast, async, auto-docs | Flask, Django |
| Supabase for DB | Dec 26 | Managed, free tier | Raw PostgreSQL |
| BYOK model | Dec 26 | Cost effective for users | Pay-per-use |
| Orange color | Dec 26 | Unique, energetic | Blue, purple |
| Next.js frontend | Dec 26 | Fast, SEO, familiar | Vue, plain React |

### 🐛 Bugs & Issues

| ID | Date | Description | Status | Resolution |
|----|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| #001 | Dec 26 | No backend exists | Open | Start tomorrow |
| #002 | Dec 26 | No API keys | Open | Use BYOK approach |

### 💡 Ideas for Later

1. **Chrome Extension** - Right-click to harvest any page
2. **API Marketplace** - Let users sell their formats
3. **Team Workspaces** - Shared templates and content
4. **Webhooks** - Notify when generation complete
5. **Bulk Operations** - Process multiple URLs at once
6. **Schedule Generation** - Daily/weekly content creation
7. **Content Monitoring** - Alert when source changes
8. **Version Control** - Track content changes over time
9. **A/B Testing** - Test different formats
10. **White Label** - Let others brand Harvest.ai
