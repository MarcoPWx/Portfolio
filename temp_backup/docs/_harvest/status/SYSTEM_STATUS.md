## 🎯 Critical Path to Working Prototype

### What We Have Working Now
```python
# ACTUALLY WORKING:
- Next.js frontend serves pages ✅
- Tailwind CSS with orange theme ✅
- Basic navigation component ✅
- Documentation website ✅

# PARTIALLY WORKING (from QuizMentor):
- Question generator script (needs adaptation)
- Basic web scraping functions
- Ollama integration example
```

### Minimum to Get Something Working (1 Week Sprint)

**Day 1-2: Backend Foundation**
- [ ] Create FastAPI project structure
- [ ] Set up basic endpoints
- [ ] Connect to Supabase
- [ ] Basic error handling

**Day 3-4: BYOK System**
- [ ] API key validation endpoint
- [ ] Secure storage in localStorage
- [ ] Cost estimation logic
- [ ] Basic UI for key management

**Day 5-6: Core Flow**
- [ ] Single scraping function
- [ ] One AI provider (OpenAI)
- [ ] One output format (Markdown)
- [ ] Simple result display

**Day 7: Integration**
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend
- [ ] End-to-end test
- [ ] Basic error states
- [ ] Deploy to staging

## 🚨 Blockers & Dependencies

### Immediate Blockers
1. **No Backend Code** - FastAPI not started
2. **No Database** - Supabase not configured  
3. **No AI Keys** - Need OpenAI API key for testing
4. **No Deployment** - Vercel/Railway not set up

### External Dependencies Needed
- [ ] Supabase account (Free tier OK)
- [ ] Upstash Redis account (Free tier OK)
- [ ] OpenAI API key ($20 for testing)
- [ ] Vercel account (Free tier OK)
- [ ] Railway account (Free tier OK)
- [ ] Domain name (Optional for MVP)

6. Add cost estimation
7. Test with real OpenAI API

### NICE TO HAVE
8. Add second output format
9. Implement caching
10. Add monitoring

## 🔮 Realistic Timeline

### Week 1 (Dec 26 - Jan 1): Foundation
- Backend API running
- BYOK system working
- One complete flow

### Week 2 (Jan 2 - Jan 8): Core Features  
- Multiple formats
- Caching layer
- Error handling

### Week 3 (Jan 9 - Jan 15): Polish
- Authentication
- Export system
- UI improvements

### Week 4 (Jan 16 - Jan 22): Production

- Monitoring
- Beta launch

## 💡 Reality Check

**What's Actually Built:**
- 20% documentation (good!)
- 5% frontend (basic setup)
- 0% backend (nothing)
- 0% integrations (none)

**Time to First Working Version:**
- Optimistic: 3 days
- Realistic: 7 days  
- Pessimistic: 14 days

**What's Blocking Us:**
- No backend code exists
- No API integrations done
- No database configured
- No deployment pipeline
