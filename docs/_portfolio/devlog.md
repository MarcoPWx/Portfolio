# DevLog - NatureQuest Ecosystem Infrastructure

## 2024-01-26: Unified Authentication System Implementation

### Architecture Decision: Centralized Auth with SSO

**Problem**: 
- Multiple products (DevMentor, QuizMentor, Harvest.ai, Omni.ai) with separate authentication
- User friction from multiple accounts
- No unified billing or subscription management
- GDPR compliance needed across all products

**Solution**:
Implemented a centralized authentication system with the following architecture:

#### 1. Central Account Dashboard (`/portfolio/ecosystem_central/dashboard/`)
- **AccountDashboard.tsx**: Main user dashboard with tabs for:
  - Overview: Product access, usage metrics, subscription status
  - Billing: Subscription tiers, payment methods, invoices
  - Security: 2FA, API keys, session management, security events
  - Privacy & GDPR: Data export, account deletion, sharing preferences

**Key Features**:
- Real-time usage tracking across all products
- Product access based on subscription tier
- GDPR-compliant data management tools
- Security event logging
- API key generation and management

#### 2. Unified Auth Store (`/portfolio/ecosystem_central/auth/authStore.ts`)
- Zustand-based state management with persistence
- Supabase integration for authentication
- SSO token generation and validation
- Product access control based on subscription tiers:
  - **Free**: QuizMentor only
  - **Pro**: QuizMentor, DevMentor, Harvest.ai
  - **Team**: All products including Omni.ai
  - **Enterprise**: All products with unlimited access

#### 3. Shared Auth Package (`/portfolio/packages/unified-auth/`)
- Reusable authentication library
- Can be imported by all products via `@naturequest/unified-auth`
- Handles cross-domain session management
- Token refresh logic

### Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed**:
- Central authentication infrastructure setup
- Account dashboard with full GDPR compliance
- Shared auth library structure
- Zustand store with Supabase integration

ðŸ”„ **In Progress**:
- SSO flow implementation
- Product integration guides

ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps**:
1. Set up Supabase project with required tables
2. Implement SSO endpoints
3. Create migration scripts for existing users
4. Deploy central auth service to accounts.naturequest.dev

## 2025-08-26: Animation Runtime Fix + Product Reasoning Recap

### What changed
- Fixed a Framer Motion runtime error caused by animating width from a number to a percentage string. WAAPI cannot interpolate 0 â†’ "85%". We now animate "0%" â†’ "85%" consistently.
- Files updated (minimal changes):
  - src/components/InteractivePortfolio.tsx
    - Roadmap progress bar: initial width '0%'
    - Skills proficiency bars: initial width '0%'
    - Escaped raw '>' in terminal prompt to avoid TSX parse warning
  - src/components/ComprehensivePortfolio.tsx
    - Skills proficiency bars: initial width '0%'

Result: Section transitions and bars animate smoothly again without console errors. All existing visuals (including the small green animated dots/particles) remain intact.

### Verification
- App Router client components ('use client') confirmed on animated pages
- Interactive animations tested with smooth transitions
- ParticlesBackground still renders small green particles and larger blurred green blobs

### Product reasoning recap (concise)

1) QuizMentor (Gamified learning)
- Value: Real-time, engaging learning with adaptive difficulty and analytics
- Differentiators: Bloom's Taxonomy validation, ethical engagement patterns, self-hosted analytics
- Status: UI and content structure solid; needs auth, persistence, and backend wiring to ship
- Risks: Cost at scale without caching; multiplayer complexity

2) DevMentor (AI pair programming)
- Value: PBML pattern learning from the actual codebase, fast local-first retrieval
- Differentiators: Hybrid Redis + pgvector, multi-agent code review/refactor/test flow
- Status: Architecture sound; prioritize SDK polish, examples, and real repos integration
- Risks: Model drift; privacy boundaries; developer onboarding UX

3) Harvest.ai (Content intelligence)
- Value: Legal, ethical content transformation with validation and sourcing
- Differentiators: Compliance-first pipeline (robots.txt, rate limiting), multi-agent validation
- Status: Prototype exists; must implement robust error handling, cost controls, and caching
- Risks: High cost without optimization; scraping reliability; provider limits

4) Omni.ai (Universal AI coding assistant)
- Value: One UI for multiple providers, hot-swap with context preservation
- Differentiators: Smart routing and cost optimization; local model support
- Status: Early stage; extension core and provider registry are the first milestones
- Risks: Provider parity; context transfer accuracy; VS Code marketplace standards

5) Unified Auth (Ecosystem SSO)
- Value: Centralized auth, subscription tiers, SSO across all products
- Differentiators: Shared SDK + cross-domain session design; GDPR tooling
- Status: Mostly ready; needs production deployment, audit, and examples
- Risks: Security hardening; consistent product integration

### Next actions (suggested)
- Ship a staging build for visual QA of animations and particles
- Add e2e sanity tests (Playwright) to assert:
  - Progress bars animate to expected widths
  - Roadmap and skills sections render without errors
  - Particles mount and loop without memory creep
- Track animation regressions with a lightweight visual snapshot step in CI

## 2025-08-28: Portfolio component optimizations and test suite stabilized

### Summary
- Extracted `RoadmapModal` into `src/components/RoadmapModal.tsx` and enabled client-side rendering.
- Introduced dynamic imports for `RoadmapModal` and `StatsDashboard` with `ssr: false` and lightweight loading fallbacks.
- Improved the Interactive Terminal reliability by handling Enter on `onKeyDown` and updated the initial banner string to avoid duplicate matches during tests.
- Updated unit/integration tests:
  - Mocked `ComprehensiveSkillsV2` via `data-testid="comprehensive-skills"`.
  - Replaced brittle single-element text queries with multi-element checks where appropriate.
  - Adjusted an integration test assertion to match current project naming.
- Test results: all Jest unit/integration tests are green (69/69). Suppressed React act() warnings in `jest.setup.js` for noise reduction.

### Notes
- TypeScript type-check still reports errors in some auxiliary demo/story files; scheduled for follow-up.
- ESLint config migration to the ESLint CLI is pending per Next.js guidance.
- A new Portfolio Status page has been added under `_portfolio/status/PORTFOLIO_STATUS.md` and Quick Links were added to `docs/README.md`.
