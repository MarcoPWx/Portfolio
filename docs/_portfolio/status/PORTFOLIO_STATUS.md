# Portfolio Project Status

Last Updated: 2025-08-28  
Project: NatureQuest Portfolio  
Status: Stable (Development)  
Version: 2.0.0

## Current Status Summary (as of 2025-08-28)

- Extracted RoadmapModal into its own file at `src/components/RoadmapModal.tsx` with client-side rendering.
- Dynamically importing heavy components with SSR disabled and lightweight fallbacks:
  - `RoadmapModal` and `StatsDashboard` now load via Next.js dynamic import (`ssr: false`).
- Improved terminal reliability:
  - Added `onKeyDown` Enter handler to the Interactive Terminal input.
  - Updated initial banner text to avoid duplicate text matches in tests.
- Tests stabilized:
  - Updated unit/integration tests to mock `ComprehensiveSkillsV2` via `data-testid="comprehensive-skills"`.
  - Adjusted brittle text queries (use getAllBy*/role/name where multiple elements may exist).
  - All Jest unit/integration tests pass locally (69/69). Act() warnings suppressed in `jest.setup.js` to avoid noise.
- Documentation consolidated:
  - Epics doc updated with completed items for dynamic imports and testing fixes.

## Known Issues and Follow-ups

- TypeScript:
  - `npm run type-check` currently reports errors in some legacy/aux components and story files. Prioritize:
    - SectionTitle usage updates (`title` prop vs children),
    - Implicit any fixes in Technical/Ultimate portfolio demos,
    - Storybook stories typings (add required `args`).
- ESLint:
  - Next.js suggests migrating to the ESLint CLI; configuration is pending. Consider running:
    - `npx @next/codemod@canary next-lint-to-eslint-cli .`
- E2E:
  - Playwright specs exist but were not executed in this session; plan a green baseline run and fix any regressions.

## Roadmap & Epics

- Central tracker: [Portfolio Epic Management](./EPIC_MANAGEMENT.md)
- Near-term priorities:
  - P1: UI Refactor & Component Library (accessibility, forwardRef, Storybook coverage)
  - P2: Testing & Quality (stabilize tests, coverage targets)
  - P3: Performance & Responsiveness (reductions for tests/reduced-motion, code splitting)
