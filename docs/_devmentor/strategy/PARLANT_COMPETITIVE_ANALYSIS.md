**Recommendation**: Position DevMentor as:
> "The AI Development Mentor That Actually Understands Your Code"
> 
> Stop wrestling with generic AI that doesn't understand your project context.
> DevMentor learns your patterns, remembers your decisions, and grows with your codebase.

### 2. **Unique Differentiators to Emphasize**

#### **DevMentor's Superpowers** (vs Parlant):
1. **Development-Focused**: Built specifically for coding, not generic customer service
2. **Pattern Learning (PBML)**: Learns from YOUR coding patterns, not just rules
3. **Multi-Agent Intelligence**: Specialized agents for different development tasks
4. **Local-First Architecture**: Your code never leaves your machine
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Gets smarter as you use it

### 3. **Website & Marketing Improvements**

#### Homepage Structure (Inspired by Parlant):
```
1. Hero: Pain Point + Solution
   "Tired of AI that doesn't understand your codebase?"
   
2. Problem Section (with emojis):
   ‚ùå Generic AI gives generic answers
   ‚ùå No memory of your project context
   ‚ùå Can't learn your team's patterns
   ‚ùå Suggests code that doesn't fit your style
   
3. Solution Section:
   ‚úÖ Learns YOUR coding patterns
   ‚úÖ Remembers your architectural decisions
   ‚úÖ Understands your project structure
   ‚úÖ Grows smarter with every interaction
   
4. 60-Second Setup:
   Simple installation with immediate value
   
5. Live Demo:
   Interactive playground showing DevMentor learning
   
6. Industry Use Cases:
   - Startups: "Ship faster with consistent code"
   - Enterprises: "Onboard developers 10x faster"
   - Open Source: "Maintain quality at scale"
```

### 4. **Technical Improvements**

#### Quick Start Experience:
```bash
# Current: Complex multi-service setup
# Proposed: Single command
npm install -g devmentor
devmentor init
devmentor start
# Browser opens to http://localhost:3001 with interactive tutorial
```

#### Simplified API (Parlant-inspired):
```typescript
import { DevMentor } from '@devmentor/sdk';

// Define your coding patterns
const mentor = new DevMentor({
  project: './my-project',
  patterns: {
    architecture: 'microservices',
    testing: 'playwright',
    style: 'functional'
  }
});

// DevMentor learns and adapts
await mentor.learn();

// Get contextual help
const suggestion = await mentor.suggest('How should I structure this API?');
```
