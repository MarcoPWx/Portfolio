# DevMentor User Journey: From Zero to Autonomous Development Ecosystem

## The Vision: Your Project's Living Brain

**DevMentor isn't just another AI coding tool - it's your project's evolving consciousness.**

While Cursor and Warp are "smart terminals," DevMentor is a **Development Operating System** that:
- **Remembers** everything about your project forever
- **Learns** from every decision and improves
- **Orchestrates** multiple AI agents working in parallel
- **Grows** with your project from day 1 to production

---

## 1. The First 5 Minutes: Magic Onboarding

### Step 1: GitHub Connect (0:00-0:30)
```typescript
User Flow:
1. Land on devmentor.ai
2. Click "Connect GitHub"
3. OAuth flow
4. Select repository
```

### Step 2: Initial Scan & Analysis (0:30-2:00)
```typescript
// What happens behind the scenes
RepoAnalyzer: {
  - Clones repository
  - Analyzes architecture
  - Detects frameworks/languages
  - Maps dependencies
  - Identifies patterns
  - Finds test coverage
  - Locates documentation
}

// What user sees
UI: {
  TopBar: "üîç Analyzing your-repo... Found React, TypeScript, 82% test coverage"
  MainView: Live visualization of repo being scanned (files appearing on canvas)
  Sidebar: Services spinning up one by one
}
```

### Step 3: The "Wow" Moment (2:00-3:00)
**Screen transforms into your project's command center:**

```typescript
interface ProjectDashboard {
  // Center: Interactive Architecture Map
  architectureCanvas: {
    nodes: Components[], // Each file/module as a node
    connections: Dependencies[], // Import/export relationships
    healthIndicators: QualityMetrics[], // Test coverage, complexity
    liveStatus: "‚ú® Your project visualized!"
  }
  
  // Right Sidebar: Active Agents
  agentPanel: {
    memoryAgent: "üß† Building knowledge base...",
    codeAgent: "ü§ñ Learning your coding style...",
    testAgent: "üß™ Analyzing test patterns...",
    pbmlAgent: "üìà Creating improvement models..."
  }
  
  // Top Bar: Real-time Analysis
  analysisBar: {
    status: "Found 3 areas for improvement",
    suggestions: ["Add tests for auth.ts", "Refactor user.service.ts", "Update dependencies"]
  }
}
```

### Step 4: First Interaction - The Glass Overlay (3:00-5:00)
**Glassmorphic overlay appears:**

```typescript
<GlassOnboarding>
  <h1>Welcome to Your Project's Brain üß†</h1>
  
  <QuickSetup>
    <Option1>
      üéØ "Set up my workflows"
      ‚Üí Opens visual workflow builder with detected patterns
    </Option1>
    
    <Option2>
      üöÄ "Start coding with AI"
      ‚Üí Opens VS Code with extension connected
    </Option2>
    
    <Option3>
      üìä "Show me insights"
      ‚Üí Deep dive into project analysis
    </Option3>
  </QuickSetup>
  
  <SmartSuggestion>
    "I noticed you use TDD. Want me to set up automated test generation?"
    [Yes, let's do it!] [Maybe later]
  </SmartSuggestion>
</GlassOnboarding>
```

---

## 2. The Living Dashboard: Multi-Agent Orchestra

### The Main Interface Concept
```typescript
interface DevMentorDashboard {
  // Top Section: Project Pulse
  projectPulse: {
    repoStatus: "main branch | 3 PRs pending | 98% healthy",
    activeAgents: ["Code Reviewer", "Test Writer", "Doc Generator"],
    runningWorkflows: ["PR Review", "Nightly Tests", "Security Scan"]
  }
  
  // Center: Dynamic Views (Tabs)
  mainView: {
    tabs: [
      "Architecture", // Visual project map
      "Workflows",    // Visual workflow builder
      "Tasks",        // Epic/Task tracker
      "Memory",       // Knowledge base explorer
      "Insights"      // PBML recommendations
    ]
  }
  
  // Left: Navigation + Quick Actions
  leftPanel: {
    quickActions: [
      "New Workflow",
      "Create Task",
      "Ask DevMentor",
      "Run Tests"
    ],
    projects: Repository[],
    workspaces: Workspace[]
  }
  
  // Right: Live Agent Activity
  rightPanel: {
    notifications: Notification[],
    agentChat: AgentMessage[],
    suggestions: Suggestion[]
  }
  
  // Bottom: Terminal/Logs (Collapsible)
  bottomPanel: {
    terminal: "Execution logs",
    metrics: "Performance data"
  }
}
```

### The Notification System - Proactive AI
```typescript
// Right sidebar notifications appear as agents work
notifications: [
  {
    agent: "PBML",
    message: "I've learned a pattern from your code. Want to apply it everywhere?",
    action: "Show me",
    priority: "suggestion"
  },
  {
    agent: "Test Engine",
    message: "New code detected without tests. Generate them?",
    action: "Generate Tests",
    priority: "warning"
  },
  {
    agent: "Memory Bank",
    message: "Similar problem solved 2 weeks ago. See solution?",
    action: "View Context",
    priority: "info"
  }
]
```

---

## 3. The Workflow Creation Experience

### Visual Workflow Builder (Like SIM.AI but Better)
```typescript
interface WorkflowBuilder {
  // Triggered by PBML suggestion or manual
  trigger: "PBML noticed you always do these 3 steps together",
  
  canvas: {
    // Pre-populated with detected patterns
    suggestedBlocks: [
      { type: "GitHub PR", config: "auto-detected" },
      { type: "Code Review", config: "your-style" },
      { type: "Test Runner", config: "your-framework" },
      { type: "Deploy Check", config: "your-pipeline" }
    ]
  },
  
  // PBML Integration - Unique to DevMentor
  pbmlAssistant: {
    suggestions: [
      "Based on your history, add security scan here",
      "You usually notify Slack after this step",
      "This workflow is similar to TeamX's - want to copy?"
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## 4. The Multi-Agent Experience

### How Services Communicate Visually
```typescript
// User sees agents as living entities
interface AgentEcosystem {
  // Visual representation in Architecture tab
  visualization: {
    style: "Animated network graph",
    nodes: [
      { id: "code-agent", status: "analyzing", connections: 3 },
      { id: "memory", status: "storing", connections: 5 },
      { id: "pbml", status: "learning", connections: 2 }
    ],
    dataFlow: "Animated particles showing data movement"
  },
  
  // Agent collaboration in real-time
  collaboration: {
    example: "Code Agent asks Memory: 'How did we solve auth last time?'",
    response: "Memory responds with context from 3 similar implementations",
    learning: "PBML notes pattern for future use"
  }
}
```

### Service Status Panel
```typescript
const ServiceStatusPanel = () => {
  return (
    <Panel title="Your AI Team">
      <ServiceCard 
        name="Code Analyst"
        status="active"
        currentTask="Reviewing PR #42"
        insight="Found 3 potential bugs"
      />
      <ServiceCard 
        name="Memory Keeper"
        status="learning"
        currentTask="Indexing new patterns"
        insight="Knowledge base: 1,247 patterns"
      />
      <ServiceCard 
        name="Test Guardian"
        status="waiting"
        currentTask="Ready for next push"
        insight="Coverage: 92% (+2% this week)"
      />
    </Panel>
  );
};
```

---

## 5. Epic/Task/Subtask Management - Autonomous + Interactive

### The Smart Task System
```typescript
interface SmartTaskManager {
  // AI-Generated Structure
  epicDetection: {
    trigger: "PBML detects you're building a new feature",
    suggestion: "This looks like an Authentication Epic. Should I create it?",
    autoGenerated: {
      epic: "User Authentication",
      tasks: [
        "Implement login endpoint",
        "Add JWT middleware",
        "Create user model",
        "Write auth tests"
      ],
      subtasks: "Auto-generated based on your patterns"
    }
  },
  
  // Autonomous Execution
  automation: {
    level: "configurable", // Full auto, supervised, manual
    example: {
      task: "Write auth tests",
      ai_action: "Test Agent generates tests",
      human_review: "Approve before committing",
      auto_complete: "Marks task done when tests pass"
    }
  },
  
  // Visual Progress
  display: {
    style: "Kanban with AI indicators",
    aiStatus: "ü§ñ AI working on 3 tasks",
    humanNeeded: "üë§ 2 tasks need your input"
  }
}
```

---

## 6. VS Code Extension - The Bridge

### Why It Still Makes Sense
```typescript
interface VSCodeIntegration {
  // Real-time Connection
  connection: {
    status: "Connected to DevMentor Brain",
    sharedContext: "Full project memory available",
    activeAgents: "All agents accessible via commands"
  },
  
  // Inline AI Features
  features: {
    codeCompletion: "Powered by your project's memory",
    errorDetection: "PBML knows your common mistakes",
    refactoring: "Based on your team's patterns",
    testGeneration: "Matches your testing style"
  },
  
  // Unique Advantages over Cursor
  advantages: {
    memory: "Remembers everything forever",
    learning: "Improves with every commit",
    context: "Understands your entire project",
    collaboration: "Synced with web dashboard"
  }
}
```

### The Extension Experience
```typescript
// In VS Code
DevMentorPanel: {
  quickActions: [
    "Ask about this code",
    "Generate tests",
    "Find similar patterns",
    "Check memory"
  ],
  
  liveSync: {
    webDashboard: "Changes reflect immediately",
    agents: "Same agents as web",
    workflows: "Trigger from IDE"
  }
}
```
