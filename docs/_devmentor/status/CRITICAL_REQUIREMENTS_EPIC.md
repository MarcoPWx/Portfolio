## ERROR HANDLING PATTERNS

### Retry Strategy
```javascript
// Exponential backoff with jitter
const retryWithBackoff = async (fn, maxAttempts = 3) => {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxAttempts) throw error;
      
      const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, attempt) + Math.random() * 1000, 10000);
      await sleep(delay);
    }
  }
};
```

### Circuit Breaker
```javascript
class CircuitBreaker {
  constructor(threshold = 5, timeout = 60000) {
    this.failureCount = 0;
    this.threshold = threshold;
    this.timeout = timeout;
    this.state = 'CLOSED';
    this.nextAttempt = Date.now();
  }

  async call(fn) {
    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      if (Date.now() < this.nextAttempt) {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN');
      }
      this.state = 'HALF_OPEN';
    }

    try {
      const result = await fn();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Cache Strategy
```yaml
Cache Layers:
  1. Browser Cache:
     - Static assets: 1 year
     - API responses: 5 minutes
     
  2. CDN Cache (CloudFlare):
     - Images: 30 days
     - CSS/JS: 7 days with versioning
     
  3. Redis Cache:
     - Session data: 24 hours
     - API responses: 5-60 minutes
     - Rate limit counters: 1 minute sliding window
     
  4. Application Cache:
     - Computed results: 5 minutes
     - Database queries: 1 minute
     
Cache Invalidation:
  - Time-based: TTL expiration

## WHAT'S MISSING (The Reality Check)

1. **API Documentation**: No OpenAPI/Swagger specs for most services
2. **Integration Tests**: Services not tested together
3. **Error Scenarios**: Haven't tested failure modes
4. **Load Testing**: No idea of capacity limits
5. **Security Audit**: No penetration testing done
6. **Monitoring**: Observability partially implemented
7. **Rollback Plan**: No documented procedures
8. **Data Migration**: No upgrade path defined
9. **Multi-tenancy**: Not properly isolated
10. **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA not fully addressed

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **TODAY**: Document all API endpoints with OpenAPI
2. **TODAY**: Create integration test suite
3. **TOMORROW**: Implement circuit breakers and retries
4. **TOMORROW**: Define caching strategy for each service
5. **THIS WEEK**: Complete guided tour integration
6. **THIS WEEK**: Load test critical paths
7. **THIS WEEK**: Security audit
8. **BEFORE BETA**: Complete error handling
9. **BEFORE BETA**: Monitoring dashboards
10. **BEFORE BETA**: User documentation

---

**Bottom Line**: We've been building features without proper requirements. This epic MUST be completed before we can claim anything is "ready" for production. Every feature needs clear acceptance criteria, error handling, caching strategy, and performance requirements.
