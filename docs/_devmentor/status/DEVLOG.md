## 2025-01-25 - Runtime Control Documentation Updates

### Key Concepts Explained
- **Idempotency**: Operations that produce the same result when applied multiple times
  - Example: Unleash seed Job can be re-run safely, won't create duplicate flags
  - ESO manifests can be re-applied without creating duplicate secrets
- **Weights (Istio)**: Traffic distribution percentages between service versions
  - Example: 90/10 split sends ~90% to v1, ~10% to v2 over time
- **Quick Canary**: Gradual traffic shift to validate new version health
  - Typical progression: 5% → 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
  - Monitor error rates, latency, and 5xx responses between steps

### Documentation Updates
- Updated RUNBOOK_runtime-control.md with concepts glossary
- Enhanced RUNBOOK_feature-flags_unleash.md with idempotent seeding section
- Added idempotency note to RUNBOOK_external-secrets_vault.md
- Confirmed RUNBOOK_canary-rollouts.md already exists with full procedure
- Verified Istio VirtualService weights at 100/0 (no active canary)

### Status
- Canary deployment scaffolding ready but disabled by default
- ai-gateway-v2.yaml deployment exists for future canary testing
- Comprehensive runbooks in place for production deployment

---

## Verification
- Cluster state
  - `kubectl get ns` shows devmentor-app|data, istio-system.
  - `kubectl get pods -A` lists api-gateway, ai-gateway, auth-service, postgresql-0, redis-cache-0, qdrant-0.
  - `kubectl get gateway,virtualservice -A` returns Istio CRs.
- Health
  - `curl -s http://localhost:8080/health` → 200 with auth/ai healthy.
  - `curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/ai/pbml/status` → JSON with ready:true when Redis reachable.
- Tests
  - Cypress smoke: green.
  - Admin PBML: green after hydration guard.

## What Was Built (by service/UI)
- services/api-gateway
  - `src/index.js`: rate limit fix; `GET /api/auth/github/login` redirect JSON; pathRewrite fix for auth; Redis URL DNS.
  - `src/middleware/healthCheck.js`: scoped checks.
  - `src/middleware/auth.js`: public endpoints include `/api/auth/github`.
- services/ai-gateway
  - `src/index.ts`: PBML emit/status; error typing; health env gate.
- services/auth-service
  - `src/index.ts`: GitHub OAuth routes wired; config centralization.
- devmentor-ui
  - Admin `src/app/admin/page.tsx`: PBMLStatusCard, IngressDiagram, ObservabilityQuickLinks, ExpectedClusterStateChecklist, HelpCenter; hydration guard.
  - Auth flow UI: `domains/auth/components/GitHubLoginButton.tsx`, `services/authService.ts`, callback page.
  - Repo analysis client: `src/services/repoAnalysisService.ts` pointing to AI Gateway.
  - Utilities: `src/lib/utils.ts`, `src/services/pbmlService.ts`.
- tests (Cypress)
  - `tests/cypress/e2e/smoke.cy.ts`, admin PBML tests (to restore after file move).

## Commands Run
```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context kind-devmentor
kind delete cluster --name devmentor
cd /Users/betolbook/Documents/github/NatureQuest/devmentor && ./scripts/deploy-k8s-istio.sh deploy
kubectl -n devmentor-app rollout restart deploy/api-gateway && kubectl -n devmentor-app rollout status deploy/api-gateway | cat
kubectl -n devmentor-app port-forward svc/api-gateway 8080:8080 >/dev/null 2>&1 &
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq
```

## Tests & Results
- UI smoke: passed.
- Admin PBML: passed post-fix.
- User-journey suite: temporarily skipped; needs selector/route updates.

## Observability Snapshots
- Grafana/Kiali/Jaeger/Prometheus accessible via port-forward; traces propagate through gateway.

## Risks & Follow-ups
- Ollama optional; keep health skip in dev.
- Ensure Redis DNS consistent across manifests.
- Strengthen gateway rate-limit to avoid nghttp2 resets during CI.

## Next Actions with Acceptance Criteria
- E2E: Unskip and update `user-journey` specs to current routes; pass locally.
- Auth: Verify GitHub OAuth end-to-end via gateway; JWT stored; 401s on protected routes when missing token.
- Analysis: Wire UI to `/api/ai/github/analyze`; show basic report; trace visible in Jaeger.
- Admin: Add live pod/service lists; one-click port-forward buttons; green tiles reflect reachability.
- Learning Center: Light up tiles based on available content; add exam/questionnaire scaffolding. 

## 2025-08-13
- UI Topbar
  - Added Quick Analyze button in `src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` that:
    - POSTs to `/api/repo/analyze`

  - Ops procedures: plan/apply, upgrades, rollbacks, uninstall, drift handling
  - Secrets: External Secrets/Sealed Secrets/operator guidance
  - CI/CD: guardrails and troubleshooting commands
  - Decision guide: when to use Helm CLI vs Terraform-managed Helm
- Next: integrate these patterns for an existing stack (ingress or observability) with example helm_release and values.

## 2025-08-23

### 2025-08-23 21:01 UTC — Redis helper implemented (frontend support)
- Implemented real Redis client in `frontend/devmentor-ui/src/server/redis.ts` using ioredis with lazy singleton
- Replaced ad-hoc Redis sets in `/api/lads/generate` with shared helper
- Added unit tests (`tests/unit/server/redis.test.ts`) mocking ioredis; covered string and JSON helpers
- Result: removed repeated warnings ("Redis getJson/setJson not configured"), caching works for diagram/index routes
- Related to epics (frontend infra support): EPIC-015 (dashboard data), EPIC-016 (architecture caching), EPIC-024 (onboarding state)

### 2025-08-23 13:13 UTC — Cluster verification and PBML route fix
- Cluster context: kind-devmentor; control plane reachable
- Namespaces present: devmentor, devmentor-app, devmentor-data, istio-system, monitoring
- Core services Running: auth-service (2/2), ai-gateway (2/2), postgres, redis, ollama (1 Running, one Pending to be scaled down)
- Istio: ingressgateway + istiod healthy; Gateway and VirtualService present
- Action: Port-forwarded istio-ingressgateway to 8080; /api/auth/health reachable
- Action: Added VirtualService HTTP path rewrite so /api/ai/pbml/* routes to ai-gateway’s /api/pbml/*
- Verify: curl http://localhost:8080/api/ai/pbml/status → { ready: true, stream: 'ai:events' }
- Next: Consider deploying api-gateway to consolidate routes on :8080; verify Redis in-cluster URLs for ai-gateway; scale Ollama to 1

Commands
```bash
kubectl config current-context
kind get clusters
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get ns
kubectl get pods -A -o wide | grep -E "istio|ai-gateway|auth-service|postgres|redis|ollama"
kubectl -n istio-system port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway 8080:80 &
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/auth/health | jq -r '.'
# Add path rewrite for PBML
kubectl patch virtualservice devmentor-routes -n devmentor --type='json' -p='[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/http/2/rewrite","value":{"uri":"/api"}}]'
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/ai/pbml/status | jq
```

### 2025-08-23 12:38 UTC — Playwright/E2E Focus Kickoff
- Scope: Frontend-only epics with strong vision alignment
  - EPIC-016: Interactive Architecture Visualizations (Pan/zoom, hover tooltips, connection highlighting, export)
  - EPIC-015: Project Dashboard Revamp (widget grid, collapsible cards, skeletons, pin persistence)
  - EPIC-024: Onboarding/Setup Wizard UX (multi-step, local persistence, Guided Tour entry)
- Test Strategy (TDD-first):
  - Unit: component behaviors (hover, collapse, persistence)
  - Integration: interactions across components (highlighted edges, theme safety, guided-tour CTA)
  - E2E (Playwright): user-visible flows per epic; screenshots, traces on retry
- Commands:
  ```bash
  # Run all Playwright tests
  cd frontend/devmentor-ui && npm run test:e2e
  # Show report
  npx playwright show-report
  # Update snapshots (when UI stabilizes)
  npx playwright test --update-snapshots
  ```
- Acceptance Criteria per epic:
  - Architecture Viz: zoom/pan controls; hover tooltips; connection highlighting; export to PNG/SVG verified via download
  - Dashboard: skeleton-to-loaded transition; collapsible cards; widget pin persists after reload
  - Onboarding: step progress persisted in localStorage; finishing shows Guided Tour CTA and launches it
- Artifacts: `frontend/devmentor-ui/test-results/`, `frontend/devmentor-ui/playwright-report/`
- Next Actions: unskip or add specs for architecture.spec.ts, dashboard.spec.ts, onboarding.spec.ts and run smoke in CI.

### 2025-08-23 14:34:23 CEST
- Section: Dashboard upgrade
- Tags: cli,observability,dashboard,prometheus,grafana,kiali

Expanded observability dashboard (scripts/obs):
- Adaptive grid: 3x2 (wide), 2x3 (tall), 2x2 fallback
- Panels: Overview | Monitoring (Grafana+Kiali summary) | Prometheus Targets | Problems | Recent Logs (--ns) | Port-forwards
- New helpers: prom_targets (Prometheus API), logs_recent (namespace logs)
- Grafana summary: lists ConfigMaps with grafana_dashboard/grafana_datasource labels and embedded files
- Kiali status: version/state if pf at :20001

Usage
- Start pf: scripts/obs pf all -b
- Launch: scripts/obs dashboard --ns devmentor 3
- Optional: pf Kiali: kubectl -n istio-system port-forward svc/kiali 20001:20001 &

Next
- Add keyboard shortcuts (n: change logs ns, s: set refresh, p: toggle targets)
- Optionally wire a kustomize-only overlay for dashboards with no manual steps

### 2025-08-23 21:27 UTC — Frontend TDD E2E & Unit Test Scaffolding
- Playwright E2E specs added: `tests/playwright/e2e/architecture.spec.ts`, `tests/playwright/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts`
- Unit test added: `tests/unit/features/architecture/AnimatedArchitecture.test.tsx`
- Selector stabilization: added `data-testid` to architecture (canvas/nodes/connections) and dashboard loading state
- Epics impacted: EPIC-016 (Architecture Viz), EPIC-015 (Dashboard), EPIC-024 (Onboarding)

### 2025-08-23 12:36 UTC
- Section: Playwright snapshots + Chromium-only run
- Tags: testing,playwright,snapshots,e2e,artifacts

Commands
- Snapshot update: `npx playwright test --update-snapshots`
- Chromium only: `npx playwright test --project=chromium --reporter=line`

Results
- Snapshot update: completed with failures; baselines updated where appropriate. See HTML report for diffs.
- Chromium-only: 32 tests → 18 passed, 1 skipped, 13 failed (54s)

Failure buckets (Chromium)
- Feature card hover target not found (strict locator on article/testid)
- Login redirect waitForURL("**/dashboard") timed out (mocked login; missing navigation)
- Password visibility toggle button not located (needs data-testid or alt selector)
- GitHub OAuth request not observed (ensure /api/auth/github is fired/mocked)
- Privacy policy modal: heading strict conflict (two nodes matched)
- Mobile: primary heading hidden at mobile breakpoint
- Accessibility: keyboard focus assertions too strict; ARIA label selection conflicts
- User journey: branding locator strict conflict; error message null string
- Interview prep: flexible heading/content expectations still too strict in some steps

Artifacts
- Test artifacts: `frontend/devmentor-ui/test-results/` (screenshots, videos, traces)
- HTML report: `frontend/devmentor-ui/playwright-report/` (open via `npx playwright show-report`)

Follow-ups
- Add `data-testid` to feature cards and password toggle in UI
- Refine privacy policy checks to use role-based headings with exact matching where unique
- After mocking `/api/auth/login`, explicitly navigate to `/dashboard` or wait for a dashboard marker
- Ensure GitHub OAuth click triggers a request to `/api/auth/github` in dev; mock response
- Loosen interview-prep heading/content assertions and add stable test ids

## 2025-08-24 — Beta Readiness Decision + Plan
- Decision: Public beta No-Go today. Start a 10–14 day Private Beta Readiness Sprint; re-evaluate Go/No-Go at the end. We will "take the time it takes."
- Source: Consolidated from docs/status/launch/BETA_READINESS_SNAPSHOT.md and per-service *_BETA_READINESS.md files.

Blockers (must clear before Go)
1) AI Gateway: add OpenAI + Anthropic; PII detection; basic cost counting; provider failover
2) Memory Service: minimal RAG (Qdrant connect + embeddings + store/retrieve)
3) Auth: CSRF, account lockout, JWT policy/secret, email verify/reset
4) Observability: single stack + dashboards; verify sidecars in Kiali
5) API Gateway: prefer REDIS_URL; add liveness/readiness probes; confirm routes
6) Postgres: persistence + backup/restore + migration strategy
7) E2E smoke: login → dashboard; tasks realtime; AI chat via gateway

Today (prep + verification)
- Update EPIC_MANAGEMENT.md with decision and sprint (done)
- Verify observability UIs by port-forwarding Grafana, Prometheus, Kiali
- Inspect api-gateway env for REDIS_URL; plan code change to prefer REDIS_URL in ioredis

Commands
```bash
# Observability quick check
kubectl get svc,deploy -A | grep -E "grafana|prometheus|loki|alert|kiali" || true
# Port-forward (adjust if already running)
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80 >/dev/null 2>&1 &
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/prometheus-k8s 9090:9090 >/dev/null 2>&1 &
kubectl -n istio-system port-forward svc/kiali 20001:20001 >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Next 48h
- Auth hardening (CSRF, lockout, verify/reset) with tests
- API Gateway: implement REDIS_URL preference + probes; rollout
- AI Gateway: wire OpenAI + Anthropic provider scaffolding
- Observability: confirm single stack; seed “Core Services” dashboard

Acceptance Criteria
- /health green across gateway/auth/ai; ingress route checks pass
- Grafana dashboards load; Kiali shows sidecars for core pods
- E2E smoke: login → dashboard, tasks update realtime, AI chat round-trip via gateway

### 2025-08-24 18:04 UTC — Epic scaffolding: Runtime Control
- Added EPIC-RUNTIME-CONTROL to EPIC_MANAGEMENT.md, covering:
  - Secrets via Vault + External Secrets Operator
  - Feature flags via OpenFeature + self-hosted provider (Unleash/Flagsmith)
  - Minimal remote config via typed flags; optional config-service
  - Istio traffic (Gateway/VirtualService/DestinationRule/ServiceEntry, mTLS)
- Created runbook: docs/infrastructure/runbooks/RUNBOOK_runtime-control.md
- Next: choose provider (default Unleash), wire OpenFeature in api-gateway and ai-gateway, and apply Istio manifest for canary subsets.

## 2025-08-25 11:41 UTC — Whitepaper consolidation (append-only)

  - docs/infrastructure/runbooks/RUNBOOK_runtime-control.md (Concepts glossary, Quick Canary Procedure)
  - docs/infrastructure/runbooks/RUNBOOK_feature-flags_unleash.md (Idempotent seeding Job)
  - docs/infrastructure/runbooks/RUNBOOK_external-secrets_vault.md (Idempotency Note for ESO reconciliation)
- Documentation updates completed:
  - Added a Concepts glossary (idempotency, weights, quick canary).
  - Added a Quick Canary Procedure (step-by-step on adjusting weights and what to watch).
  - Added an “idempotent seeding” section with the new Job (how to apply it, logs, and which flags it creates).
  - Added an Idempotency Note clarifying that re-applying ESO resources is safe and how reconciliation behaves.
- Next: wire CI doc-citation checks and add a canary/rollback drill to the calendar.

## 2025-08-25 11:55 UTC — SCDD 7–11 tuned to /docs practice (append-only)
- Rewrote Sections 7–11 to explicitly anchor to /docs paths and to the three runbooks (runtime-control, feature-flags_unleash, external-secrets_vault).
- Added Definition of Done bundle (Code + Contract + Tests + Runbook reference + DEVLOG/SYSTEM_STATUS + Evidence).
- Clarified RBC mapping and Playwright evidence linkage to incidents.

## 2025-08-25 11:59 UTC — SCDD philosophy revision (append-only)
- Revised sections 7-11 to focus on methodology philosophy rather than prescriptive details
- Section 7 now explains HOW I ship safely through connected context and rehearsed patterns
- Section 8 describes evidence-first observability as respect for future debugging
- Section 9 shows DevMentor as runbook-first operational design with compound learning
- Section 10 frames governance as accumulated wisdom from incidents, not imposed rules
- Section 11 provides incremental adoption path starting with memory system, not tools
- Key insight: capturing what you already do and making it reusable for humans and AI
