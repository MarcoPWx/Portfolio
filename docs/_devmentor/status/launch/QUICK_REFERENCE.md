# Quick Launch Reference

## Your Story (30 seconds)
"I got tired of explaining my codebase to AI every morning. Built a memory layer that persists context. It's helping me ship faster. Wondering if others have the same problem."

## SCDD in One Line
Strategic Context-Driven Development: AI that never forgets your project.

## LinkedIn Profile Update
```
Technical Founder
AI Development Platform (Stealth)
Building SCDD - solving AI context loss
```

## The Beta Ask
"Looking for a few developers to test my solution to AI context repetition. It's rough but working. DM if interested."

## Key Messages
- Solving MY problem (not revolutionizing)
- It's rough but functional
- Looking for feedback, not customers
- Building together, not selling

## Daily Routine
Morning: Check LinkedIn, respond to DMs
Afternoon: Fix bugs from feedback
Evening: Quick LinkedIn check, thank people

## Responses Ready
- Interest → "DMing you! It's rough but that's why I need help"
- Skeptical → "Fair! Just solving my own problem"
- Technical → "Using [X]. What's your approach?"

## Success = 
- Week 1: Few people testing
- Week 2: Finding real bugs
- Month 1: Someone using for real work

## Don't
- Use big numbers
- Say "revolutionary"
- Compare to big companies
- Hide problems
- Oversell

## Do
- Share actual bugs
- Ask for help
- Thank everyone
- Stay humble
- Be specific

## Remember
You're inviting collaboration, not launching a product.
