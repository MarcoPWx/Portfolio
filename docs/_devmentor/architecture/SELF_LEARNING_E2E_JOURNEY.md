## 📚 Part 1: The Three Learning Channels

### Channel 1: Code Analysis Learning
**When you write code or analyze repositories:**

```typescript
// USER ACTION: Pushes code or analyzes a repo
git push origin main
// OR
RepoAnalyzer.analyze("https://github.com/user/project")

// WHAT HAPPENS:
1. RepoAnalyzer Service → Analyzes code structure
   └─> Detects: Patterns, frameworks, test coverage, complexity
   
2. Blackboard Pattern → Coordinates knowledge
   └─> CodeAnalysisAgent: "Found React patterns"

4. During the session:
   Answer correct → Increase difficulty
   Answer wrong → Provide hints, decrease difficulty
   Time taken → Adjust pace
   Confidence → Modify explanation depth
   
5. Post-session:
   └─> Update mastery levels
   └─> Schedule next review (SM-2 algorithm)
   └─> Generate performance report
   └─> Create next learning goals
```

## 🔌 Part 2: The Blackboard Pattern - Central Coordinator

The Blackboard Pattern is the **brain's cortex** that coordinates all learning agents:

```typescript
class BlackboardSystem {
  // The shared knowledge space
  private blackboard: KnowledgeBase = {
    currentProblem: null,
    contributions: [],
    solution: null
  }
  
  // Specialized agents that contribute knowledge
  private agents = {
    codeAnalyzer: new CodeAnalysisAgent(),      // Analyzes code patterns
    repoAnalyzer: new RepoAnalyzerAgent(),      // Understands project structure
    promptAnalyzer: new PromptAnalyzerAgent(),  // Interprets user questions
    memoryBank: new MemoryBankAgent(),          // Retrieves past knowledge
    pbmlEngine: new PBMLAgent(),                // Applies learned patterns
    bloomValidator: new BloomAgent(),           // Validates cognitive levels
    learningEngine: new AdaptiveAgent()         // Personalizes learning
  }
  
  async solve(userAction: UserAction) {
    // 1. Initialize problem on blackboard
    this.blackboard.currentProblem = userAction
    
    // 2. All agents examine the problem and contribute
    await Promise.all(
      Object.values(this.agents).map(agent => 
        agent.examine(this.blackboard)
      )
    )
    
    // 3. Agents collaborate by reading each other's contributions
    while (!this.blackboard.solution) {
      for (const agent of Object.values(this.agents)) {
        const contribution = await agent.contribute(this.blackboard)
        if (contribution) {
          this.blackboard.contributions.push(contribution)
        }
      }
      
      // 4. Check if we have enough knowledge to form a solution
      this.blackboard.solution = this.synthesize()
    }
    
    return this.blackboard.solution
  }
}
```

### Real Example: User Submits Bad Code

```typescript
// USER ACTION: Commits this code
function getData() {
  fetch('/api/data')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
}

// BLACKBOARD COORDINATION:
CodeAnalyzer: "Missing error handling, no async/await"
RepoAnalyzer: "Project uses TypeScript + async patterns"
MemoryBank: "User made similar mistake 3 times this week"
PBMLEngine: "Pattern detected: Forgetting error handling"
BloomValidator: "User at 'Apply' level, needs 'Analyze'"
LearningEngine: "Generate error handling tutorial"

// SYNTHESIZED SOLUTION:
1. Immediate: Show inline suggestion with correct pattern
2. Short-term: Create quiz on error handling
3. Long-term: Add to learning path
4. Pattern: Save for future prevention
```

## 🧬 Part 3: The PBML Engine - Pattern Learning

The Pattern-Based Machine Learning engine learns from EVERYTHING:

```typescript
class PBMLEngine {
  patterns = {
    coding: [],      // How you write code
    mistakes: [],    // What you get wrong
    learning: [],    // How you learn best
    preferences: []  // What you prefer
  }
  
  async learn(event: DeveloperEvent) {
    // Extract patterns from any event
    const pattern = await this.extractPattern(event)
    
    // Store with context
    pattern.context = {
      time: Date.now(),
      project: getCurrentProject(),
      skillLevel: getUserSkillLevel(),
      frequency: this.getPatternFrequency(pattern)
    }
    
    // If pattern repeats 3+ times, it's significant
    if (pattern.frequency >= 3) {
      await this.createRule(pattern)
      await this.notifyLearningEngine(pattern)
    }
  }
  
  // Example patterns PBML learns:
  patterns = {
    "Always uses arrow functions": { confidence: 0.95 },
    "Forgets null checks in API calls": { confidence: 0.87 },
    "Learns better with visual examples": { confidence: 0.92 },
    "Prefers TypeScript over JavaScript": { confidence: 1.0 },
    "Struggles with recursion": { confidence: 0.78 },
    "Masters concepts after 3 examples": { confidence: 0.83 }
  }
}
```
