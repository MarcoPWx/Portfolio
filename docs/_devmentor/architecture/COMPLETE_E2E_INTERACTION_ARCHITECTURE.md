```

### Detailed Error Recovery Patterns
```yaml
Network Errors:
  Strategy: Exponential backoff with jitter
  Max Attempts: 3
  Delays: [1s, 2s, 4s]
  Jitter: Random 0-1s added

    - Try refresh token
    - If fails, redirect to login
    - Preserve current state
  403 Forbidden:
    - Show permission error
    - Suggest upgrade if needed
    - Log for audit

Rate Limiting:
  429 Too Many Requests:
    - Parse retry-after header
    - Queue request
    - Show countdown to user
    - Execute when allowed

Server Errors:
  500 Internal Error:
    - Log full stack trace
    - Show generic message
    - Offer retry button
    - Report to monitoring
  503 Service Unavailable:

## Critical Missing Pieces

### What We Don't Have
1. **Service Mesh**: No proper service discovery
2. **Message Queue**: No async job processing
3. **Workflow Engine**: No complex flow orchestration
4. **Feature Flags**: No gradual rollout capability
5. **A/B Testing**: No experimentation framework
6. **Audit Logs**: No compliance tracking
7. **Backup System**: No disaster recovery
8. **Multi-tenancy**: No proper isolation
9. **Rate Limiting**: Basic implementation only
10. **Circuit Breakers**: Not implemented anywhere

### Required Infrastructure
```yaml
Must Have Before Beta:
  - Service mesh (Istio configured)
  - Message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
  - Feature flags (LaunchDarkly/Unleash)
  - Centralized logging (ELK stack)
  - Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
  - Metrics collection (Prometheus)
  - Alert management (PagerDuty)
  - Backup solution (Velero)
  - Secret management (Vault)
  - Load balancer (properly configured)

Nice to Have:
  - Workflow engine (Temporal/Airflow)
  - A/B testing (Optimizely)
  - Advanced monitoring (DataDog)
  - CDN (CloudFlare)
  - Auto-scaling (HPA/VPA)
```

## Deployment & Rollback Strategy

### Blue-Green Deployment
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Current State"
        LB1[Load Balancer] --> B1[Blue v1.0]
        B1 --> DB1[(Database)]
    end
    
    subgraph "Deploy New Version"
        LB2[Load Balancer] -.-> G1[Green v1.1]
        G1 --> DB2[(Database)]
        B2[Blue v1.0] --> DB2
    end
    
    subgraph "Switch Traffic"
        LB3[Load Balancer] --> G2[Green v1.1]
        B3[Blue v1.0] -.-> DB3[(Database)]
        G2 --> DB3
    end
    
    subgraph "Rollback if Needed"
        LB4[Load Balancer] --> B4[Blue v1.0]
        G3[Green v1.1] -.-> DB4[(Database)]
        B4 --> DB4
    end
```

## Success Metrics & Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators
```yaml
User Metrics:
  - Daily Active Users (DAU)
  - Monthly Active Users (MAU)
  - User Retention (D1, D7, D30)
  - Session Duration
  - Feature Adoption Rate

System Metrics:
  - API Response Time (p50, p95, p99)
  - Error Rate
  - Uptime (99.9% target)
  - Request Volume
  - Cache Hit Rate

Business Metrics:
  - Conversion Rate
  - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
  - Lifetime Value (LTV)
  - Net Promoter Score (NPS)
  - Churn Rate

Technical Metrics:
  - Code Coverage
  - Technical Debt Ratio
  - Deploy Frequency
  - Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
  - Change Failure Rate
```
