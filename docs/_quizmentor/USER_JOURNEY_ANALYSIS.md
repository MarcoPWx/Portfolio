## 💡 Insights

### What's Working
- Strong gamification design
- Good test coverage philosophy
- Comprehensive documentation
- Modern tech stack

### What's Not Working
- No user can actually use the app
- Services exist in isolation
- No data persistence
- No auth = no users
- Legal compliance missing

### Biggest Risks
1. **Authentication** - Complete blocker
2. **Privacy** - Legal requirement
3. **Data Persistence** - Nothing saves
4. **Service Integration** - Nothing connected
5. **User Retention** - No engagement loop

---

## 📝 Summary

**User Journey Readiness**: 25%
**User Story Completion**: 35%
**Production Readiness**: 10%

The app has strong foundations but lacks the critical connections that make it functional. The UI screens exist, the services exist, but they're not talking to each other. It's like having all the parts of a car but no assembly.

**Critical Path**: Authentication → Service Wiring → Data Persistence → Engagement Loop → Launch
