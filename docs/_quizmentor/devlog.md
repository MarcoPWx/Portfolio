## 🐛 Known Issues

### Critical (P0)
1. **White Screen on Web with PaywallScreen**
   - Description: PaywallScreen causes white screen when included
   - Browsers affected: Firefox (confirmed), possibly others
   - Workaround: Using simplified PaywallScreen
   - Root cause: Likely subscription service mock or styling issue

### High (P1)
1. **Firefox Compatibility**
   - Some React Native Web features don't work properly in Firefox
   - Recommendation: Primary support for Chrome/Safari, Firefox as secondary

2. **Package Version Mismatches**
   - Several packages need version updates for Expo SDK 53
   - Non-blocking but should be addressed
